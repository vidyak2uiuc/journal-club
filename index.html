            <h2>Fall 2023</h2><br>
            The purpose of this journal club is to review articles of interest to the diverse group that consists of students and collaborators
            that have the dubious fortune of being in the Chacko group in CS @UIUC. A central focus is the intersection of computer 
            science and scientometrics. We avoid discussing articles concerned with using or proposing metrics of scientific quality. Perhaps this
            makes us "bibliometric denialists". Presentations are made each week, mostly by graduate students. Effort is made to keep the discussions 
            objectively critical.<br><br>
            
            At the end of each presentation, all assembled are asked to vote NIH scores on the article that was presented. This, considering 
            individual preferences, 
            reasonable expectations for a journal article, and the group discussion. A score of 1 is assigned to a 'walk on water' article, 9 
            for a perfectly bad article, and 5 for a middle of the road article. Scores of 2,3,4 and 6,7,8 fall between these markers. Like all 
            metrics, the scores assigned should not be taken too seriously. Instead, they serve as an approximate indicator of the collective 
            enthusiasm of the group assembled on a given day.
