            <h2>Fall 2023</h2><br>
            The purpose of this journal club is to review articles of interest to the diverse group that consists of students and collaborators
            in the Chacko group in CS @UIUC. A central focus is the intersection of computer science and scientometrics. Presentations are made 
            each week, mostly by graduate students. Effort is made to keep the discussions objectively critical.<br><br>
            
            At the end of each presentation, all assembled vote NIH scores on the article that was presented considering individual preferences, 
            reasonable expectations for a journal article, and the group discussion. A score of 1 is assigned to a 'walk on water' article, 9 
            for a perfectly bad article, and 5 for a middle of the road article. Scores of 2,3,4 and 6,7,8 fall between these markers. Like all 
            metrics, the scores assigned should not be taken too seriously. Instead, they serve as an approximate indicator of the collective 
            enthusiasm of the group assembled on a given day. <br> <br> <hr> <br>
